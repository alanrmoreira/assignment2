DESIGN PRINCIPLES

For this website, I used some design principles such as Contrast, Hierarchy, Proportion and Balance, aiming to focus on my content. 
The Contrast principle is clearly seen on the header and footer. 

Since this is a timeline website, the buttons/menu bar with the timeline is in evidence. This is the principle of Hierarchy.  

On the main section, the content (text and image) is organized according the principles of Proportion and Balance.
